eet
------------------------------------------
Eet is a tiny library designed to write an arbitary set of chunks of
data to a file and optionally compress each chunk (very much like a
zip file) and allow fast random-access reading of the file later
on. It does not do zip as a zip itself has more complexity than is
needed, and it was much simpler to implement this once here.

It also can encode and decode data structures in memory, as well as
image data for saving to eet files or sending across the network to
other machines, or just writing to arbitary files on the system. All
data is encoded in a platform independant way and can be written and
read by any architecture.

Build instructions:
  unpack eet-1.2.3-X-src.tar.bz2
    if you use setup to install this src package, it will be
	 unpacked under /usr/src automatically
  cd /usr/src
  cygport ./eet-1.2.3-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/eet-1.2.3-X-src.tar.bz2
  /usr/src/eet-1.2.3-X.tar.bz2
  /usr/src/libeet-devel-1.2.3-X.tar.bz2
  /usr/src/libeet1-1.2.3-X.tar.bz2
